# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection

## Topic

The aim of this project is to develop a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm capable of accurately identifying metastatic cancer in small image patches extracted from larger digital pathology scans. Metastatic cancer, the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to other parts of the body, is a critical factor in cancer prognosis and treatment planning. However, manually analyzing large-scale pathology scans to detect metastatic cancer can be time-consuming and prone to human error.

In this project, I am going to use deep learning algorithm (CNN), including data processing, model traing, model testing and model improving, to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches.
